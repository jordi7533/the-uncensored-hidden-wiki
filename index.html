                <h1 id="history">The Hidden Wiki</h1>

                <p>The Hidden Wiki was a dark web MediaWiki wiki operating as Tor hidden services that could be
                    anonymously edited after registering on the site. The main page served as a directory of links to
                    other .onion sites.</p>

        

                <h2 id="history">History</h2>

                <p > The first Hidden Wiki was operated through the .onion pseudo top-level domain which
                    can be accessed only by using Tor or a Tor gateway. Its main page provided a community-maintained
                    link directory to other hidden services, including links claiming to offer money laundering,
                    contract killing, cyber-attacks for hire, contraband chemicals, and bomb making. The rest of the
                    wiki was essentially uncensored as well and also offered links to sites hosting child pornography
                    and abuse images.
                
                    </br> </br>

                    The earliest mention of the hidden wiki is from 2007 when it was located at
                    6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion.
                    </br> </br>
                    A well known iteration of the Hidden Wiki was founded some time before October 2011, coming to
                    prominence with its associations with illegal content.
                    </br> </br>
                    At some point prior to August 2013, the site was hosted on Freedom Hosting.
                    </br> </br>
                    In March 2014 the site and its kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion domain was hacked and redirected to Doxbin.
                    Following this event, the content began to be mirrored to more locations. During Operation Onymous
                    in November 2014, after its Bulgarian hosting was compromised, the site served a message from law  enforcement.
                     </p>
                    </br> </br>
                   <p><b>The New link in 2023 is : <a href="https://thehiddenwiki2023.com">thehiddenwiki2023.com</a></b> </p> 
                   
                

                <h2>Successors</h2>

                <p id="successors">There are several .onion websites hosting successors based on mirrors of the Hidden Wiki; as such,
                    there is no longer one single official Hidden Wiki. Many are hosted for accessibility reasons,
                    due to frequent downtime and instability of the main wiki, while others were launched in order to
                    filter links to child pornography.</p>
